# About the Project
Voice disorders, or pathologies, can significantly impact an individual's ability to communicate effectively. Early detection of these conditions is crucial for timely intervention and treatment. This project focuses on developing a web-based application that uses deep learning to detect voice pathologies using speech signal data.

## Project Overview
This application combines the power of a **Liquid State Machine (LSM) model** with a ReactJS frontend, seamlessly integrated using Flask. The LSM model, a type of spiking neural network, is particularly effective in processing temporal data like voice signals. By analyzing various acoustic features of voice recordings, the application can accurately identify potential pathologies.

## Key Features
- The LSM model processes speech signal data to detect anomalies that may indicate a voice disorder.
- A dynamic and responsive user interface built with ReactJS, allowing users to easily upload voice recordings and view results.
- The Python-based Flask framework serves as the bridge between the LSM model and the frontend, ensuring smooth communication and data handling.
- Along with the predicted pathology, the application displays the spectrogram of the audio, providing a visual representation of the voice signalâ€™s frequency content.
- Designed with the end-user in mind, the application provides a simple and intuitive interface for uploading voice files and receiving instant feedback.

## Dataset
The model was trained and tested on a comprehensive [Saarbruecken Voice Database](https://stimmdb.coli.uni-saarland.de/index.php4#target) of voice recordings, labeled with various types of voice disorders. We have trained the current model on 2 types of voice pathology, Vocal Polyp and Laryngitis and on Healthy voice. This dataset enabled the model to learn to distinguish between healthy and pathological voice patterns with high accuracy.
